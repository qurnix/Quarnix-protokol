Gasless Layer-2 for Instant Transactions & Seamless Web3 Adoption

Quarnix is a next-generation Layer-2 protocol designed to enable zero-gas, high-speed, and scalable blockchain interoperability. By combining zkRollup and optimistic scaling techniques, Quarnix creates a developer-friendly and user-first ecosystem for global Web3 adoption.

Key Features

- Zero Gas Fee: True frictionless experience through meta-transactions and relayer system.
- Instant Finality: Lightning-fast transaction processing and confirmation.
- Cross-Chain Interoperability: Seamless bridging with Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, and Solana.
- Modular Architecture: Flexible and customizable infrastructure for dApp developers.
- ZK-Enhanced Security: Scalability and privacy combined through zero-knowledge proofs.
- Sustainable Tokenomics: Anti-inflation model to maintain ecosystem stability.

Ecosystem Components

- Quarnix Protocol: Core Layer-2 with zkRollup + relayer infrastructure.
- Quantum Narrative Chain: UX-optimized modular rollup chain.
- QRX Token: Utility token for gas, staking, and governance.
- QLight Wallet (Roadmap): Smart AA wallet with native gasless support.
